# Delete facebook group posts script v1
A script that will delete all the posts in a group.

A simple file containing javascript which you need to run in your browser while the window for the group you want to delete posts for is open.


Note: it's a sloppy piece of code, so needs to be restarted after every 10 minutes or so. 

If anyone would like to help make it better, feel free to contribute. Needs callbacks. 



For people who don't know how to use it, right click on the page, click inspect, then click on the console tab, and paste the code there, then hit enter.
